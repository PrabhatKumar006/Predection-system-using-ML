This code is made by using Python language. the code uses the pinciples of ML(machine learning).

This code mainly dependent on libraries. so it is very much necessary to import all the libraries like pandas, matplotlib,sklearn.
the created machine needs very big amount of data to learn how to predict. so it is compulsory to provide it data of approx 1500 rows.
the code then evaluated that how much it is efficient or we had find the accuracy of machine.
then it is saved in computer then it can be run by simpliy calling the machine in new code which gives the input to the machine.
